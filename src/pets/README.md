# Pet authoring guide

Each pet is a self-contained behavior pack. Its folder owns both its animation files and the `flow.json` file that decides what the pet does in every Herdr state.

For the full schema and validation details, see [`docs/behavior-packs.md`](../../docs/behavior-packs.md).

## Folder layout

```text
src/pets/
  my-pet/
    flow.json
    walk.png
    work.png
```

The build discovers every `src/pets/*/flow.json` automatically. The `id` in `flow.json` must exactly match the folder name. Assets are resolved only inside that pet's folder, including optional nested directories.

To add a pet:

1. Create `src/pets/<pet-id>/`.
2. Put its transparent APNG animations in that folder.
3. Add `flow.json` and define all five required states.
4. Run `./scripts/check.sh` from the repository root.
5. Rebuild both packaged applications before distributing the change.

## Minimal `flow.json`

```json
{
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "id": "my-pet",
  "packVersion": "1",
  "clips": {
    "walk-fast": {
      "asset": "walk.png",
      "durationMs": 800,
      "role": "locomotion",
      "sourceFacing": "right",
      "mirror": true
    },
    "work": {
      "asset": "work.png",
      "holdAsset": "done.png",
      "durationMs": 600,
      "role": "stationary",
      "scale": 1.2
    }
  },
  "states": {
    "idle": {
      "completion": "restart",
      "flow": {
        "type": "sequence",
        "steps": [
          { "type": "play", "clip": "work" },
          { "type": "wait", "durationMs": 1800 }
        ]
      }
    },
    "working": {
      "completion": "restart",
      "flow": {
        "type": "sequence",
        "steps": [
          {
            "type": "move",
            "clip": "walk-fast",
            "durationMs": 2400,
            "speedPxPerSecond": 30
          },
          { "type": "play", "clip": "work", "count": 2 }
        ]
      }
    },
    "blocked": {
      "completion": "restart",
      "flow": { "type": "play", "clip": "work" }
    },
    "done": {
      "completion": "restart",
      "flow": {
        "type": "sequence",
        "steps": [
          { "type": "play", "clip": "work" },
          { "type": "wait", "durationMs": 1600 }
        ]
      }
    },
    "unknown": {
      "completion": "restart",
      "flow": { "type": "wait", "durationMs": 1000 }
    }
  }
}
```

## Required states

Every pack must define exactly these states:

- `idle`
- `working`
- `blocked`
- `done`
- `unknown`

Visibility is ordinary flow data. No state receives special renderer behavior. Bundled pets stay visible while `idle` with one gentle stationary play followed by a 1800 ms wait, and their `done` flow replays its clip followed by a 1600 ms wait instead of freezing, so neither state ever parks on a single frame. A custom pack may still disappear while idle by using `hide`, or freeze on a final pose with `hold`, and the renderer treats those identically.

Entering a different state starts from a visible baseline. A `hide` action hides the complete citizen, including its pet, label, shadow, and clickable area. A later `play` or `move` action shows it again. A `wait` in the same flow preserves the current visibility.

## Clip names and fields

Keys inside `clips` can be any valid local name, such as `walk`, `dig`, `hammer`, or `work-fast`. They do not need to match filenames or predefined actions.

A clip name must:

- start with a lowercase letter;
- contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens;
- contain at most 64 characters;
- be unique inside that pet's `flow.json`.

Each clip supports:

- `asset`: an APNG path relative to the pet folder;
- `holdAsset`: a transparent static PNG required for clips used by visible `hold` states;
- `durationMs`: the exact duration of one APNG play cycle;
- `role`: `locomotion` or `stationary`;
- `sourceFacing`: `left` or `right`, defaulting to `right`;
- `mirror`: whether it can turn safely at screen edges, defaulting to `true`;
- `scale`: optional display scale from `0.5` through `2.5`, defaulting to `1`.

Use a `locomotion` clip only when the artwork is safe to mirror and is intended for `move`. Scaling changes screen space but keeps the APNG's intrinsic aspect ratio.

## Flow actions

- `play` displays a named clip. Optional `count` repeats its declared duration.
- `move` displays a locomotion clip and moves forward for `durationMs` at `speedPxPerSecond`.
- `wait` consumes time without changing the current clip or visibility.
- `hide` hides the complete citizen for `durationMs`.
- `sequence` runs each item in `steps` in order.
- `repeat` runs one nested `flow` a fixed number of times.
- `choose` selects one weighted branch deterministically for the agent and state entry.

Example weighted choice:

```json
{
  "type": "choose",
  "choices": [
    { "weight": 3, "flow": { "type": "play", "clip": "work" } },
    { "weight": 1, "flow": { "type": "wait", "durationMs": 500 } }
  ]
}
```

`completion: "restart"` starts the state's root flow again when it finishes. `completion: "hold"` keeps the final pose and visibility without movement. The validator requires `holdAsset` for clips reachable from a visible `hold` flow, so the APNG cannot keep looping. Every bundled pack uses `restart` for `done` — one celebration play followed by a 1600 ms wait — and the APNG continues animating during the wait.

## APNG requirements

Each clip's `asset` must be a valid APNG. It must:

- use 8-bit RGBA pixels with a genuinely transparent canvas;
- contain at least two meaningful frames;
- loop indefinitely;
- use positive frame durations whose total exactly matches `durationMs`;
- stay within a 2048 × 2048 canvas;
- contain valid PNG checksums, chunk ordering, animation sequence numbers, and frame operations;
- avoid empty frames, hidden-RGB-only changes, and imperceptible one-pixel changes.

A `holdAsset`, when present, must be a visible transparent static 8-bit RGBA PNG. The checker composites APNG disposal and blending before comparing visible output.

## Useful limits

- Timed actions: 16–60,000 ms
- Restarting state cycle: 100–300,000 ms
- `play` and `repeat` count: 1–100
- Movement speed: 1–200 pixels per second
- Clip scale: 0.5–2.5

The validator also limits nesting, node counts, and choice branches so malformed packs cannot stall the renderer.

## Check your work

Run:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh
```

The checks validate the JSON schema, local asset references, flow timing, movement roles, APNG payloads, TypeScript build, Rust code, source-file line limits, and packaged binary architecture.
